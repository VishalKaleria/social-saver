## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Download Failed?**
    1.  Try updating `yt-dlp` and `gallery-dl` from the "Dependencies" page. Websites change frequently, and updated engines are often required.
    2.  Ensure the URL is correct and the content is publicly accessible.
    3.  For private content or sites requiring login, ensure you have configured cookies correctly in the "Image & Gallery DL" settings or global "Settings" -> "Advanced" (for yt-dlp).
*   **"FFmpeg not found"?**
    *   Social Saver relies on FFmpeg for merging video/audio and format conversions. Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your system and accessible in your system's PATH, or specify its path in Social Saver's settings (if such an option is available). (Usually, Social Saver bundles or helps manage this).
